## AI Movie Recommender

 [Try it here!](https://syedm83.github.io/ai-movierecs/)

A cozy web app that recommends movies based on your mood selections using AI-powered text embeddings and cosine similarity. 


__Overview__

This app lets users select up to 3 mood tags (like *drama*, *comedy*, *sci-fi*, etc.) and generates personalized movie recommendations that best match those moods.

It works by embedding the user's mood query and comparing it to precomputed embeddings of movies stored in a JSON file. Cosine similarity is used to measure how close the query is to each movie's embedding vector.

The top matching movies are shown along with their tags and relevance score.


__How It Works__

- **Movie Embeddings:**  
  A JSON file contains movie data, including a precomputed 512-dimensional embedding vector for each movie generated by a universal sentence encoder.

- **Query Embedding:**  
  The selected moods are joined into a string and embedded with the Universal Sentence Encoder model from TensorFlow.js.

- **Cosine Similarity:**  
  The cosine similarity between the user query embedding and each movieâ€™s embedding is calculated to score relevance.

- **Boost by Tag Matches:**  
  Movies that have tags matching the selected moods get a small boost to their similarity score.

- **Recommendation:**  
  Movies with a similarity score above a threshold are sorted and the top 5 are displayed.
